# uOCal 
uOCal is a web extension that parses you uOZone schedule and generates an iCal (ics) file. It is useful if you want to easily import your class schedule to your calendar app.

> [!NOTE]  
> All processing happens in your browser. Your data never leaves your device.

## Features
- Parses all your classes (including Lectures, Labs, Tutorials, DGDs etc...)
  - Automatically excludes non-classes like COP100 or FLS3500
- Includes Address & Room Number and Class Section (See [Options](#options))
- Works with both English and French version of uOZone
- Private by design: all computation happens locally, with no servers or third-party processing involved
- Free and open-source

> [!NOTE]
> For privacy reasons, in the capture above:
> - Course codes and class names are obfuscated (e.g. `CXX 4XXX` instead of the actual course code).
> - Locations/addresses are also partially obfuscated for privacy.
> - Class time has also been shifted
> 
>In a real schedule import, youâ€™ll see the full course names and locations exactly as they appear in the university portal. (See [Options](#options))
